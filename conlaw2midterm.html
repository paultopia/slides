# Conlaw II Mid-Semester Black-Letter Review

### Gowder, 3/2019




---

## Procedural Due Process


- Individualized Determination vs General Law (Londoner/Bi-Metallic)

- A.K.A. "adjudication vs legislation"

---

## Procedural Due Process

- Only triggered when there's a life/liberty/property right

- Property rights most interesting. Typically gov't benefits that look like an entitlement, reliance/importance and mandatory nature.

- No "bitter with the sweet": state decides the substantive scope of the right but constitution sets minimum bar for procedural protection

---

## Matthews (Balancing) Test

- Individual interest

- Government interest

- Risk of erroneous deprivation

Provisions tend to be variations on a theme of notice and opportunity to be heard. Questions include: pre or post-deprivation review? Right to counsel? Right to cross-examine? Right to discovery? Etc.

---

## EPC Classification: an algorithm

1.  Is there a classification?

- Facial classification

- Disparate intent

- Disparate application 

- NOT disparate impact (contrast with Title VII)

---

## EPC Classification: an algorithm

2.  What kind of classification?

- Suspect, semi-suspect, or neither?

- Here is where questions like "is sexual orientation/pregnancy discrimination sex discrimination" come in.

---

## EPC Classification: an algorithm

3.  Apply the appropriate level of scrutiny

(Reminder: this applies to the feds too, thanks to Bolling v. Sharpe, theory is 5th amendment due process)

---

## Levels of Scrutiny: Strict Scrutiny

- Primarily applies to race (and a handful of other narrow classifications)

- Classification must be **narrowly tailored** to achieve a **compelling interest**. A.k.a. Government usually loses.

- Special case of university-level affirmative action: diversity is a compelling interest, but narrow tailoring requires "holistic" rather than points-based/quota.

---

## Levels of Scrutiny: Intermediate Scrutiny

- Primarily applies to race (also "legitimacy" but this rarely comes up)

- Difficult to apply. Formal standard is that classification must be **substantially related to an important gov't interest**, but unclear how close that is to strict scrutiny. U.S. v. Virginia prohibition on generalization seems to be close; other formulations permit more over/under-inclusiveness than strict scrutiny would.

- One possible difference: permissibility of broader remedial/advancement purposes.

---

## Levels of Scrutiny: Rational Basis

- Law must be rationally related to legitimate government interest.

- Unlike strict/intermediate scrutiny, does not require interest be actual government motive. Can cook up one after the fact/for litigation, as long as gov't actor could have reasonably aimed for it.

- Default rule for classifications not included in other categories.

- Government usually wins. Exception: "rational basis with bite," which may or may not exist, but possibly represents extra scrutiny where government looks like there's animus going on.

---

## Fundamental Rights

- Second route into strict scrutiny. Get strict scrutiny if gov't classifies with respect to suspect class **or** infringes a fundamental right.

- Can be equal protection-ish (government discriminates in fundamental right along non-suspect classification, like "redheads get twice as many votes"), or due-process-ish (government just bans something, like abortion). Realistically, plead both.

- Two types of fundamental right: (1) enumerated, either directly to feds or indirectly via incorporation (we'll talk about soon), and (2) unenumerated, via "substantive due process."

---

## Unenumerated Fundamental Rights

- The dominant textual theory is that they're the part of liberty protected by the due process clause.  

- Two main categories

  - Family/Intimate Typically focused on marriage, sexuality, family, cases tend to involve things like parenting or gov't poking around in the bedroom. Griswold, Roe, Obergefell. Not general bodily autonomy/right to die. Remember Casey undue burden test.

  - Democratic. Voting (e.g. equal protection-based "one person one vote" Reynolds standard), right of association extension to 1st amendment.
