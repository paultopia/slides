## Critical Race Theory: Basic Ideas

### Paul Gowder, CRT seminar, 9/10/19

---
class: middle

Critical race theory is a big tent. But most CRT theorists believe most of the following things, even if probably nobody believes all of them.

---
class: middle

### Law and Standpoint

- Legal cognition is not independent of standpoint within the system. The way we understand the law and its effects within the world depend on social position.
- One of the key goals of CRT is to bring the perspective of minoritized racial groups into legal doctrine and scholarship, through tools like narrative.

### Social Construction of Race

- Race is not a natural, biological, category.  
- At the same time, it's not *just* a mistake. There's a sense in which race is a real phenomenon; it's just a social one.

### Institutional Racism

- Racism is not just (and perhaps not even primarily) a property of individuals who think nasty thoughts and say or do nasty things.
- Rather, racism is institutional, it exists in the structures (including legal structures) by which society is organized, and those structures and individual behaviors interact with and reinforce one another.
- And this implies that to get rid of racism, mere individual or institutional "colorblindness" isn't sufficient; what is needed is color-conscious efforts to reform institutions and remedy the wrongs they have caused.

---

### Intersectionality

- Racial oppression is not separate from oppression on the basis of gender/gender identity, class, disability, sexual orientation, minoritized religion, and other identity categories.
	- Different racial groups are also subordinated in different ways. One long-standing question that CRT has wrestled with is how much emphasis to place on the American black-white binary as opposed to other racializations.
- These identity categories interact with one another in complex ways in an individual, they're not just additive.

---

### Interest Convergence

- One of the most influential ideas in CRT, associated in particular with the work of Derrick Bell, the idea of interest convergence is that gains for subordinated groups tend to only be achievable when they also promise gains for superordinated groups. 
	- Example: concessions to civil rights movement arguably partly attributable to efforts to improve international reputation against Soviet propaganda efforts highlighting American racism.

---

### Intellectual Ancestors

- Critical legal studies: skepticism of legal objectivity, neutrality.
	- But also a potentially problematic (and privileged) critique of rights.

- Civil rights movement: (obviously) primary concern with racial equality
	- But also a potentially problematic orientation toward colorblindness, focus on individual actors bad behavior.
