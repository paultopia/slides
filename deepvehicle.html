# Law as Machine Learning

- Machine learning as function approximation 
  - *Classification*: find the function embedded in the head of a human mapping features to label

-- 

- Legal reasoning as function
  - engine: yes, weight: 95lbs, wheels: 4 -> vehicle: yes

# Problem 1: defining the features

- Machine learning on structured datasets
  - someone has to decide what columns to put in

--

- Throw unstructured data at a deep neural net and let it invent the features?
  - How do you avoid fitting on what the judge had for breakfast that morning? 

---

# Solution to Problem 1: Legal argumentation(!!)

- Following and distinguishing cases as feature selection

  - Prosecutor says the space separates nicely on weight, everything over 90 pounds is a vehicle.
  
--

  - Defendant introduces a column for things that go "woof" to distinguish the St. Bernard/separate the space differently.

---

# Problem 2: Innovation and Novelty

- Any model you can construct classifies everything made of metal with 4 wheels as a vehicle
  - Then someone shows up in a wheelchair. 
  - If this is truly novel, we need a judge to integrate equity/common-law innovation.

---

# Integrating ML with Doctrine

- Classifiers typically don't produce "vehicle" or "not vehicle, they produce P(Vehicle).
