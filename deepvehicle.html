## Vehicles in the Park: A Dataset

Weight| Wheels | Engine? | Vehicle?
------|------- | --------|---------
5     | 3      | T       | T
90    | 2      | T       | F
10    | 8      | F       | F

## Law as Machine Learning

- Machine learning as function approximation 
  - Classification: find the function embedded in the head of a human mapping features to label

## Law as Machine Learning

- Machine learning as function approximation 
  - Classification: find the function embedded in the head of a human mapping features to label
- Legal reasoning as function
  - engine: yes, weight: 95lbs, wheels: 4 -> vehicle: yes

## Separating Feature-Space

## Problem 1: defining the features

- Machine learning on structured datasets.
  - someone has to decide what columns to put in the dataset.

--

- Throw unstructured data at a deep neural net and let it invent the features?
  - How do you avoid fitting on what the judge had for breakfast that morning? 

---

## Solution to Problem 1: Legal argumentation(!!)

- Following and distinguishing cases as feature selection.

  - Prosecutor says the space separates nicely on weight, everything over 90 pounds is a vehicle.
  
--

  - Defendant introduces a column for things that go "woof" to distinguish the St. Bernard/separate the space differently.

---

## Problem 2: Innovation and Novelty

- Any model you can construct classifies everything made of metal with 4 wheels as a vehicle.

--

  - Then someone shows up in a wheelchair. 
  - If this is truly novel, we need a judge to integrate equity/common-law innovation.

---

## Integrating ML with Doctrine

- Classifiers typically don't produce "vehicle" or "not vehicle, they produce P(Vehicle).
  - There's no natural law that says P(Vehicle) > .5 --> Vehicle. Can choose arbitrary thresholds.

--

- Rule of lenity --> increase the threshold for classifying acts as criminal?

---

## Bias and Variance

- Fundamental ML tradeoff: capture all your data or generalize to unseen observations? (overfitting illustration swiped from statisticsbyjim.com)

---

## Bias and Variance

- Fundamental ML tradeoff: capture all your data or generalize to unseen observations? 
- Parallel in problems like clearly established for ยง1983 qualified immunity.
  - Could ML set clearly established threshold? 
  - Could such a model be used to force existing doctrine to stop overfitting?

---

## Legal Cognition Ain't Just Cognition

- Most of what lawyers do isn't fitting law to facts. Legal cognitions are integrated with social functions that we don't know how to automate. 

- But maybe we can use machine learning as a precision tool.
