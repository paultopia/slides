# Reconstituting We the People 

### Frederick Douglass and Jurgen Habermas in Conversation

### Paul Gowder



---

## Constitutional Theory's Legitimacy Obsession


- Originalism vs. living constitutionalism: how should we read the Constitution in order to make it legitimate?

- Countermajoritarian problem: is the Constitution compatible with democratic legitimation?

- Tradition: Athens, Lincoln

- Contemporary iteration: post-Warren court debate over judicial role, Cooper v. Aaron, Roe v. Wade, neutral principles, etc. 


---

## First Wave Constitutional Theory (Ely-ish)

- The *demos* is a corporate body. 

- The Constitution is legitimate because it creates the institutional form of the people.

- Constitutional review is legitimate when it supports the ability of the people to act in that institutional form.


---

## The Incompleteness of First-Wave Constitutional Theory (Waldron/Seidman-ish)

We disagree, legally and politically, about how the demos should be structured---why should our 2018 decisions be bound by contestable interpretations of what people in 1788 ratified?


---

## Second Wave Constitutional Theory

- Habermas, Benhabib, Ackerman, Michelman, Post & Siegel, etc.

- Civic republicanism merged into constitutional theory

---
## Transgenerational Constitutional Authorship 

- Constitution as continuing conversation

- Identification with the demos and constitution as a scheme of shared values

- Simulatenously takes out countermajoritarian problem and problem of constituent power

--

If every generation adds its stamp on the constitution . . .

and we’re all pursuing the same values . . .

and the decisions can be revisited across generations . . .

then we‘re all the framers, and we’re not stuck with court-imposed or dead-hand-imposed institutional decisions.


--

## Here's the Problem

Black Americans have been persistently excluded from the demos, and this persistent exclusion undermines the assumptions on which 2nd-wave constitutional theory depends.

- the correct way to sort out the problem is to draw on Black American constitutional thought

---

## One Strain (of many) in Black American Constitutional Thought

- The demos does not yet exist; for that reason, the Constitution is not democratically legitimate even in the generous terms of 2nd-wave constitutional theory. 

- But that doesn’t mean we should toss it out. The Constitution of the present is worth defending as a foundation for the Constitution and the demos of the future.

## Three Broad Features

- Claimant critique 

- Cynical faith

- Alchemy of identity

## Douglass as Extension to Habermas

So long as the Constitution can provide ground demands for genuine exclusion, we can treat it as provisionally valid. Should that inclusion be achieved, the *demos* is retroactively created, and the second-generation theory gains justificatory power.

“We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future. To all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can be gained from the past, we are welcome. But now is the time, the important time. Your fathers have lived, died, and have done their work, and have done much of it well. You live and must die, and you must do your work. You have no right to enjoy a child’s share in the labor of your fathers, unless your children are to be blest by your labors.” - Frederick Douglass

--

“To say that blacks never fully believed in rights is true; yet it is also true that blacks believed in them so much and so hard that we gave them life where there was none before. We held onto them, put the hope of them into our wombs, and mothered them—not just the notion of them. We nurtured rights and gave rights life. And this was not the dry process of reification, from which life is drained and reality fades as the cement of conceptual determinism hardens round—but its opposite. This was the resurrection of life from 400-year-old ashes; the parthenogenesis of unfertilized hope.” - Patricia Williams

---

“Negroes also know... that you prepare yourself for desegregation and the opportunities to be released thereby before that freedom actually exists. Indeed, it is in the process of preparation for an elected role that the techniques of freedom are discovered and that freedom itself is released.” - Ralph Ellison

--

“One law then, at least, we are by our position destined to exhibit; and that is that the enslaved should remain upon the soil, and amid the institutions which enthral them in order to bring liberty to the one by purifying the other... It is our destiny to prove that even this exception is wrong, and therefore contrary to the highest interests of the whole people, and to eradicate from the Constitution this exception, so contrary to its general principles.“ - James McCune Smith

---

“This is not very different from the act of faith demanded by all those marches and petitions while Martin was still alive. One could scarcely be deluded by Americans anymore, one scarcely dared expect anything from the great, vast, blank generality; and yet one was compelled to demand of Americans—and for their sakes, after all—a generosity, a clarity, and a nobility which they did not dream of demanding of themselves. Part of the error was irreducible, in that the marchers and petitioners were forced to suppose the existence of an entity which, when the chips were down, could not be located—i.e., there are no American people yet: but to this speculation (or desperate hope) we shall presently return.” - James Baldwin
